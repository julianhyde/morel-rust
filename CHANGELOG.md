## <a id="0.9.0" href="https://github.com/hydromatic/morel-rust/releases/tag/v0.9.0">0.9.0</a> / 2026-08-24

Morel Rust's second release. Release 0.2.0 could parse the whole
language but evaluate only a fraction of it; this release adds query
expressions, user-defined types, and Datalog support, doubles the size
of the standard library, and now runs in the browser via WebAssembly.

The version number matches that of
[Morel Java](https://github.com/hydromatic/morel) version 0.9.0, released
[two weeks](https://github.com/hydromatic/morel/blob/main/HISTORY.md#0.9.0)
before this release, with which this release is
feature-compatible. Our goal is to be compatible with the Morel
language as implemented by Morel Java, and our strategy is to copy the
`.smli` test scripts from that project and get them to
pass. Compatibility is therefore measured by how much of Morel Java's
script corpus Morel Rust reproduces line for line; at this release, it
is 91%, about 28,000 lines over 64 files. Much of the difference is
Morel Java's ability, provided by
[Apache Calcite](https://calcite.apache.org) and missing in Morel
Rust, to translate expressions to SQL and execute them via JDBC.

Key features:
 * Query expressions are evaluated, not merely parsed: `from`, `join`
   (including outer joins), `where`, `group`, `compute`, `order`,
   `take`, `skip`, `yield`, `yieldAll`, `into`, `through`, `exists`,
   `forall`, and the set operations `union`, `except` and `intersect`.
 * A query may scan an unbounded variable, if a step bounds it: the
   compiler inverts predicates, tightens ranges, and materializes the
   extent of any finite type.
 * User-defined types: `datatype` (including polymorphic and
   recursive), `type` aliases, records and record modifiers.
 * Overloading (`over`, `val inst`), let-polymorphism, and qualified
   types.
 * The standard library has 450 functions and values in 27 structures,
   up from 256 in 14 in release 0.2.0.
 * The shell has command-line editing, persistent history, syntax
   highlighting, tabular output, and a `-e` option that evaluates a
   single expression.
 * Morel Rust runs in the browser, compiled to WebAssembly.
 * Morel Rust builds with Rust 1.93.1 or later.

* Lint: Ban fully-qualified paths
* Make test scripts resilient to changes in the order of `bag` values
  ([morel#334](https://github.com/hydromatic/morel/issues/334))
* In CI, run tests in release mode (in addition to debug mode)
* Suppress `clippy::result_large_err` in parser files
* Lint: Prevent redundant `set("mode", "evaluate")` and `set("mode",
  "validate")` statements
* Add a utility to re-enable sections of test scripts that already work
* Make sure that every `.smli` file is called from a test in `smile.rs`

### Component upgrades

* Bump pest from 2.1 to 2.8
* Move minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) down from 1.95.0 to
  1.93.1 (while still supporting all later versions including
  `stable`)

### Site and documentation

* In release notes, add release name (e.g. `0.9.0`) as an anchor
* Release 0.9.0 ([#49](https://github.com/hydromatic/morel-rust/issues/49))
* Document and test various recursion patterns
  ([#39](https://github.com/hydromatic/morel-rust/issues/39))

## <a id="0.2.0" href="https://github.com/hydromatic/morel-rust/releases/tag/v0.2.0">0.2.0</a> / 2025-10-23

Initial release.

There are too many changes to list here. Suffice it to say, much has
been done, and much more is left to do. Our goal is to be compatible
with the Morel language as implemented by
[Morel Java](https://github.com/hydromatic/morel), and our strategy is
to copy the `.smli` test scripts from that project and get them to
pass. Large sections of those scripts currently run under `set
("mode", "validate")`, which parses expressions but does not resolve
types of execute, and we are gradually converting sections to `set
("mode", "evaluate")`.

Key features:
 * The parser is complete.
 * Type resolution (via the Hindley-Milner algorithm and unification)
   is complete for expressions, function declarations, and built-in
   types including `list`, `option`, `either`.
 * Evaluation is complete (but not very efficient) for simple
   expressions including lists, lambdas and closures.
 * There are 256 built-in functions in 14 structures.
   [`Bool`](https://smlfamily.github.io/Basis/bool.html),
   [`Char`](https://smlfamily.github.io/Basis/char.html),
   [`General`](https://smlfamily.github.io/Basis/general.html),
   [`Int`](https://smlfamily.github.io/Basis/int.html),
   [`List`](https://smlfamily.github.io/Basis/list.html),
   [`ListPair`](https://smlfamily.github.io/Basis/list.html),
   [`Math`](https://smlfamily.github.io/Basis/math.html),
   [`Option`](https://smlfamily.github.io/Basis/option.html),
   [`Real`](https://smlfamily.github.io/Basis/real.html),
   [`String`](https://smlfamily.github.io/Basis/string.html), and
   [`Vector`](https://smlfamily.github.io/Basis/vector.html)
   are based on the Standard ML Basis Library;
   [`Either`](https://github.com/SMLFamily/BasisLibrary/wiki/2015-002-Addition-of-Either-module)
   is a proposed extension to the Standard ML Basis Library; and
   `Bag` and
   `Sys`
   are Morel-specific.

Among the many remaining tasks to achieve parity with Morel Java are
type-resolution and execution of query expressions (`from`, `forall`,
`exists`), external data (from the file system or from a database via
ODBC or JDBC), and user-defined types.
