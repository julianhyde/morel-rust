  (* "compare (x, y)" returns LESS, EQUAL, or GREATER according to
   * whether its first argument is less than, equal to, or greater
   * than the second.
   *
   * Comparisons are based on the structure of the type
   * &alpha;. Primitive types are compared using their natural order;
   * Option types compare with NONE last; Tuple types compare
   * lexicographically; Record types compare lexicographically, with
   * the fields compared in alphabetical order; List values compare
   * lexicographically; Bag values compare lexicographically, the
   * elements appearing in an order that is arbitrary but is
   * consistent for each particular value. *)

  (* "count list" returns the number of elements in list. Often used
   * with `group`, for example `from e in emps group e.deptno compute
   * countId = count`. *)

   * d in depts where empty (from e where e.deptno = d.deptno)`. *)

  (* "iterate initialList listUpdate" computes a fixed point, starting
   * with `initialList` and calling `listUpdate (prevList, newList)`

   * empty (after subtracting the elements seen on prior
   * iterations). *)
