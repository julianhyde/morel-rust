# Documentation Style Guide

## Comments
- All comments must end with a period.
- Use complete sentences.
- Avoid stating the obvious.

## Documentation Comments
- Use `///` for public APIs, `//` for internal code.
- Write in third-person declarative voice: "Returns the value" not
  "Return the value".
- Use present tense and active voice.

### Structure
```rust
/// Parses the input string into an abstract syntax tree.
///
/// Returns an error if the input contains invalid syntax.
fn parse(input: &str) -> Result<Ast, ParseError> {
    // Convert the raw token into a parsed expression.
    let expr = self.parse_token(token)?;
}
```

## Module Documentation
```rust
//! Parser for the Morel language.
//!
//! This module provides functionality for parsing Morel source code
//! into abstract syntax trees.
```

## Error Messages
- Use sentence case and end with a period.
- Be specific and suggest solutions when possible.

```rust
return Err("Failed to parse expression: unexpected token 'let' at line 42."
    .into());
```

## Test Documentation
- Use descriptive `snake_case` names.
- Explain the scenario and expected outcome.

```rust
#[test]
fn test_parse_fails_with_unclosed_parenthesis() {
    // Arrange: Create expression with unclosed parenthesis.
    // Act: Parse the expression.
    // Assert: Verify parsing fails with appropriate error.
}
```

## Commit Messages
- Use imperative mood: "Add parser support".
- Capitalize first letter, keep under 72 characters.
