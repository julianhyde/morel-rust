# Morel

A functional query language.

### Download and build

```bash
$ git clone git://github.com/hydromatic/morel-rust.git
$ cd morel-rust
$ cargo build; ./target/debug/morel
```

### Run the Morel shell

```bash
$ cargo run
morel-rust version 0.2.0 (rust version 1.95.0)
- "Hello, world!";
> val it = "Hello, world!" : string
```

Type control+D to exit the shell.

For quick testing, use the `-e` flag.

```bash
$ cargo run -- -e "1 + 2"
val it = 3 : int

$ cargo run -- -e "from i in [1,2,3] where i > 1"
val it = [2,3] : int list

$ cargo run -- -e 'let fun double x = x * 2 in map double [2,3,4] end'
val it = [4,6,8] : int list
```
